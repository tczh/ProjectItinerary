# ProjectItinerary

ProjectItinerary is a web-application development that showcases what individual travellers wants. People will be able to upload their past itineraries for different locations. In return, they get a small fee when another person purchases their itineraries. The website would be a one-stop portal for travellers to be able to look through other travellersâ€™ itineraries. This helps them save time having to plan their inteinary. With this solution, it targets travellers who are too busy to plan their itinerary but wishes to go on a free and easy trip.
